# SH2Unpack

This tool is a Silent Hill 2 file extractor and was written to help a friend with a video about the game.

I hope it can be useful for other people interested in SH2 as well.

## Downloads

## Usage

This is a commandline tool, which means you'll be running it in the terminal, cmd.exe, or your platform equivalent. 
Double-clicking or dropping files on it will do nothing.

**NOTE: This tool operates on files from the PS2 version of the game. It was not tested with other versions, which are beyond its scope.**
The only specific version of the game this tool was developed around is the NTSC Greatest Hits version, also known as v2.01.
Other versions haven't been tested yet.

Also, you'll have to copy all files from a game ISO to another folder. The example below assumes the files are in a folder called "SH2". 

This tool currently has one command `unpack` that takes one argument `-i <input file>` and one last argument that's the output directory.
That's where extracted files go.

Here's an example:

```
$ sh2unpack unpack -i ./SH2/SLUS_202.28 ./SH2Unpack/
```

The tool will output something like:

```
sh2unpack v1.0-dirty [10c3baa]
Input: <path>/SH2/SLUS_202.28
Output Folder: <path>/SH2Unpack/
Version detected: SLUS_202.28, NTSC v2.01 (Greatest Hits)
Extracted 3825 files.
```

If there are other versions of the game you think this tool should support, please file an issue.

Modded versions are not *and will not be* officially supported.
A way to skip the hash recognition step and manually provide offsets will be implemented at a later date.
